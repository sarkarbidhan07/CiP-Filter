# CiP-Filter
Write a program that asks the user to enter an image file, loads that file and applies the “Code in Place” filter.

Photo of Stanford Main Quad on a nice day.
Same photo as previous but tinted pinkish purple.
To apply the Code in Place filter, you are going to change every pixel to have the following new red, green and blue values, based off the pixels old red, green and blue values:

new red value = old red value * 1.5
new green value = old green value * 0.7
new blue value = old blue va
